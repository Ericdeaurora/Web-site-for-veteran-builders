        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            At Veteran Builders, our story is one of dedication, service, and a passion for creating something lasting. Founded by Eric DeAurora and Philip Marchman, two U.S. Army veterans, our mission is to bring honesty, quality craftsmanship, and a personal touch to every project we take on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up surrounded by the construction world, we both developed a deep respect for hard work and the details that make a house a home. After years of military service, we realized we could use those values—discipline, integrity, and teamwork—to build something meaningful for homeowners in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Veteran Builders specializes in crafting custom decks, outdoor living spaces, and residential remodeling projects. Based in the heart of Georgia, we proudly serve the Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair areas. Every project we undertake reflects our commitment to transforming ideas into reality while building trust and long-lasting relationships with our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
