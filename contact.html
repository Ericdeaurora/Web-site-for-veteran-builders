    <div class="accordion">
        <h3 class="accordion-header">1. Initial Consultation</h3>
        <p>We begin with a thorough consultation to understand your needs, preferences, and budget. Whether it’s a custom deck, outdoor living space, or home renovation, we’ll work with you to develop a plan that reflects your style and goals.</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">2. Transparent Proposal</h3>
        <p>After the consultation, we provide a detailed proposal outlining the scope of work, materials, timeline, and costs. Our transparent quoting process ensures there are no surprises along the way.</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">3. Contract and Deposit</h3>
        <p>Once the proposal is approved, we formalize the project with a clear and concise contract. This protects both parties and ensures expectations are aligned. A deposit is collected to secure your spot on our schedule and initiate the project.</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">4. Design and Permits</h3>
        <p>Our team finalizes the design, ensuring it meets your specifications. We handle the permitting process, adhering to local building codes and requirements, so you can relax while we take care of the details.</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">5. Construction Begins</h3>
        <p>With materials sourced and plans in place, we begin construction. Our team keeps the worksite organized, safe, and professional at all times. We stay in constant communication, updating you on progress and addressing any questions or concerns.</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">6. Change Orders</h3>
        <p>We understand that your vision may evolve during the construction process. If changes or upgrades to the original scope of work are requested, they will be documented through a formal Change Order Agreement. This ensures clear communication and protects both the Customer and Veteran Builders, keeping the project on track and within agreed terms.</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">7. Quality Assurance</h3>
        <p>Before completion, we conduct a thorough inspection to ensure every detail meets our high standards. From material quality to craftsmanship, we deliver results that last.</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">8. Project Completion</h3>
        <p>When the work is done, we walk through the finished project with you to ensure it meets your expectations. Final payment is only collected after you are fully satisfied with the results.</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">9. Ongoing Support</h3>
        <p>We stand by our work. With product warranties and a commitment to your satisfaction, you can trust that we’re here for you long after the project is complete.</p>
